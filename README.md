Tic Tac Toe

Currently a standalone game featuring X's and O's, this is a simple tic tac toe game that can be played by two people on the same machine.

 I built this project to expand my understanding of Object Oriented Programming (OOP). While working on the game I was having an issue with the display of markers on a few of the tiles. Thanks to to the modularity of OOP, it was pretty easy and intuitive to narrow down where the problem was. 

I plan to integrate this game with another project of mine, Henry's Space Odyssey. I'm going to alter the theme and design of the game to be space oriented. Possible features include playable against the machine, instead of X's and O's markers will be planets.
